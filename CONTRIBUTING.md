## Building the source code ##

To build the source code, please refer to https://pnp.github.io/powershell/articles/buildingsource.html

## Keeping your fork up to date
Before starting on any new submissions, please ensure your fork is up to date with the upstream repository. This avoids frustration and challenges for us to validate and test your submission.

## Cmdlets will have to use common verbs
 
The verb of a cmdlet (get-, add-, etc.) should follow acceptable cmdlet standards and should be part of one of the built in verbs classes (VerbsCommon, VerbsData, etc.):
